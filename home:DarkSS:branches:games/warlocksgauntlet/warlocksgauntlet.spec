%description
Warlock's Gauntlet: binary file.

Warlock's Gauntlet is a dynamic, top-down shooter (well, spell-caster) game,
placing you - the player - in the role of a battlemage.

The hero travels through maps filled with monsters, gaining experience and
learning new spells. The game is similar to titles like Gauntlet or Diablo.
The game features 25 random-generated levels which should amount to about
three hours of gameplay; the player character can find over 60 distinct
spells. There is no networked multiplayer, but the game includes a hot-seat
two-player mode. The game available entirely for free.
